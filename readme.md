**Achieve project requirements of the web science college course in an actual real business product.**

- Answer three tasks from the course project. These tasks require to perform a study on an excerpt of the LastFM data set. In order to do so these tasks are represented like app features.    
- The initial dataset is retrieved from [Grouplens HetRec 2011 ](http://grouplens.org/datasets/hetrec-2011/). This dataset provides a strong base structure despite it's old age. This problem is solved by scheduled jobs app. These schedules jobs, retrieve new data for last.fm API, and update the old dataset continously.  
- The app calculates data as dictated by the four project requirements. Represents the result using graphs, charts and analytica report. Due to the continously updated data (scheduled), the results have a higher chance of being accurate.
