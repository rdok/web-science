**This web app acts like the project requirements of the web science college course is an actual real business product.**  
It focuses on answering the four tasks from the course project. These tasks require to perform a study on an excerpt of the LastFM data set. In order to do so these tasks are represented like app features.   
The app retrieves and caches for one week data from [last.fm](http://www.last.fm) ([as per their guidelines](http://www.last.fm/api/tos)). Then it calculates data as dictated by the four project requirements, and represents the result using graphs, charts, etc.
